## Project Overview

The **TFGQL** project provides a flexible GraphQL API for interacting with Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise resources, including organizations, teams, workspaces, runs, and more. It wraps the underlying REST API, exposing a strongly typed schema with advanced filtering, rate-limit handling, and streaming pagination under the hood.

Curious how this compares to a shell script that calls the REST API?  Check out the [comparison page](Concepts/direct-vs-graphql.md)

# No Frills Starter

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="Homebrew" default>
    ```bash
    brew tap jeremymefford/tfgql
    brew install tfgql
    export TFGQL_JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
    tfgql
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="container" label="Docker">
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/jeremymefford/tfgql:latest
    export TFGQL_JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
    docker run -p 4000:4000 ghcr.io/jeremymefford/tfgql:latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
The `TFGQL_JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable is not strictly required, but highly recommended otherwise you'll need to mint a new JWT every time you restart `tfgql`
:::

The service listens on [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) by default. Set the environment
variables in the previous section before launching (`TFGQL_JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
`TFE_BASE_URL`, etc.).

For Linux hosts download the matching binary from the
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/jeremymefford/tfgql/releases), unpack
it and run it directly. Windows users should deploy via the Docker container (no
native Windows binary is currently published).

## Exploring the API

Open GraphiQL at:


### [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)


Check out the [use cases](Use%20Cases/use-cases.md)
:::info
Read [this](#exchange-a-tfc-token-for-a-jwt) to learn how to set up authentication
for requests in GraphiQL.
:::

### Exchange a TFC Token for a JWT

Every GraphQL request must include a JWT issued by the server. Exchange your Terraform API token by calling the auth endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<endpoint>/auth/token \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tfcToken":"<your terraform api token>"}'
```

The response contains an encrypted token and expiration timestamp:

```json
{ "token": "<jwe>", "expiresAt": "2025-02-07T18:21:34.000Z" }
```

Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all GraphQL calls:

```bash
curl http://<endpoint>/ \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <jwe>' \
  --data '{"query":"{ __typename }"}'
```

#### GraphiQL authentication setup

##### Step 1
Open [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) in your browser. The GraphiQL auth prompt appears automatically.

##### Step 2
Paste your Terraform Cloud / Terraform Enterprise token and click **Authenticate**.

##### Step 3
GraphiQL exchanges that token at `POST /auth/token`, then stores the encrypted JWT and expiry in browser session storage for subsequent requests.

:::tip
Something not working with your auth? Click **Logout** in the GraphiQL token bar, then authenticate again.
:::

##### Step 4
Run queries directly. GraphiQL automatically attaches `Authorization: Bearer <encrypted-jwt>` to GraphQL requests while you are authenticated.

## Basic Queries

See [use cases](Use%20Cases/use-cases.md) for more real-world queries

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="orgs" label="Orgs" default>
    ```graphql
      query {
        organizations {
          id
          name
        }
      }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="teams" label="Teams & Users" default>
    ```graphql
      query {
        teams(includeOrgs: ["<my-org>"]) {
          id
          name
          users {
            id
            username
          }
        }
      }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="workspaces" label="Workspaces" default>
  ```graphql
    query {
      workspaces(includeOrgs: ["my-org"]) {
        id
        name
        locked
        description
      }
    }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

## Filtering Data

Use the `filter` argument to narrow results. For example, fetch teams named like "ci_%":

```graphql
query {
  teams(filter: { name: { _ilike: "ci_%" } }) {
    id
    name
    organization { id }
  }
}
```

See the [Concepts](Concepts/) page for filter operators.

---

## Nested Queries

GraphQL supports nested relationships in a single request:

```graphql
query {
  organizations {
    name
    teams(filter: { name: { _ilike: "%dev%" } }) {
      name
      users(filter: { username: { _eq: "alice" } }) {
        id
        username
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::info
Each nested resolution is only aware of the parent context.  Therefore it is not possible to do `where` style filters like "fetch all the teams that have a user named like X".

If you filter on a nested relationship, it will filter only at the nested level.  Extending the previous example, if you fetched all teams with a user filter on the users, the result will be **ALL** teams and only filtering the users.  It will not be only teams that meet the user criteria.

There are a couple custom queries that allow passing filters for different levels of resolution, but those are bespoke and cannot be broadly applied.  See this [ADR](Architecture%20Decision%20Records/filter-vs-where.md) if you want more info.
